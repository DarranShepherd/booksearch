# ASP.Net 4 MVC 5 BookSearch Starter

A basic Angular app skeleton to be used to as a starting point for an interview tech test.

The requirement is to create a book search, consuming the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/volumes/list)

If you already have a good grounding in Angular, go wild, show your best practices and show how to build a maintainable Angular app. If not, then this test is about showing how you can research and problem solve. Use this starting point to get up and running and figure out how to consume the API ([hint](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http)).

This version of the starter is based on ASP.Net MVC 5 so should be suitable for use in Visual Studio 2013 or Visual Studio 2015. The preferred ASP.Net 5 based version can be found [here](https://github.com/DarranShepherd/booksearch-aspnet5).
